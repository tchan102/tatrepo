## Prework

### App Description
`TODO://` It is a pre-work to CodePath's Intro to Mobile Development class
It has five objects which are a button to change backgroud color, a button to change text color, a button to change text by user input, a button to change text to "Goodbye", and a double-tab gesture to reset the page.
I changed the action of Change View Color and Change Text Color. It was originally changing to one color. However, I ammend the code, now it changes to a random color each time the user tap.
